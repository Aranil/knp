# knp

A Workflow to automate the Landsat-8 image masking and retrieving of vegetation indices by means of EASI Modelling in Python (PCI Geomatics).
This Workflow includes follow steps
- cloud and water masking based on PQA file (main.py)
- mosaicking of different paths (main.py)
- calculation of indices (indices.py) 
- export as GeoTiff file

This work was done in frame of the internship at the Centre for Geographical Analysis (CGA, Stellenbosch University) and at Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena from 02.09.2017 until 08.02.2018.
Many thanks to Chris Coetzee (chriscz) for teaching me Python and contributing to this project.
