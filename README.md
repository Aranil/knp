A Workflow to automate Landsat-8 image processing and calculation of vegetation indices by means of EASI Modelling (Python 2.7, PCI Geomatics 2018).

This Workflow includes follow steps
- cloud and water masking based on PQA file (main.py)
- mosaicking of different paths (main.py)
- calculation of indices (indices.py) 
- export as GeoTiff file

This work was done in frame of the internship at Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena (& Centre for Geographical Analysis (CGA), Stellenbosch University) from 02.09.2017 until 08.02.2018.

Many thanks to Chris Coetzee (chriscz) for teaching me Python and contributing to this project.
