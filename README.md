This workflow was developed to automate the processing of Landsat-8 images and calculation of vegetation indices using EASI Modelling in Python 2.7 and PCI Geomatics 2018. The project was undertaken during internship at Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena and the Centre for Geographical Analysis at Stellenbosch University, from September 2, 2017, to February 8, 2018.

This Workflow includes follow steps
- cloud and water masking based on PQA file (main.py)
- mosaicking of different paths (main.py)
- calculation of indices (indices.py) 
- export as GeoTiff file
